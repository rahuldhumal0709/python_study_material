# Time Complexity
# time taken by program to get executed

# lst = [6,8,19,30,4,90,8,5,1,4,6,7,67,7,4,445]
# Best Case = lst[0]
# Average Case = 8 iteration
# Worst Case = 15 iteration

# Asymptotic Notation
# 1. Big O 
# 2. Big Omega 
# 3. Big Theta

# 1.
# Big 0 - upper bond (worst case)

# [1,2,3,4,5.....100]

# f(n) <= cg(n) 
# n >= n0
# c > 0
# n0 >= 1

# f(n) = O(g(n))
# kilometer -> km
# big oh/o -> O

# n => input
# f(n) => function/method/single line statement/ formula/ algo
# c => constant value - which is used to statisfy the equation
# g(n) => time complexity (worst)
# t => time taken


# 2. 
# Big Omega - lower bond (best case)

# f(n) >= cg(n)
# n >= n0
# c > 0
# n0 >= 1

# f(n) = Ω(g(n))



# 3.
# Big Theta - in between lower and upper bound (average case)

# c2g(n) <= f(n) <= c1g(n)
# n >= n0
# c1,c2 > 0
# n0 >= 1

# f(n) = ϴ(g(n))
