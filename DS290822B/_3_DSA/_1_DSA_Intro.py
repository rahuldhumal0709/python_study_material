# DSA - Data Structure and Algorithm
# Data Structure is a collection of data, the relationship amoung them and the operations
# that can be applied on that data
# orgranizing the data
# managing the data

# (bricks,cement,rodes,woods) -> supervisor -> building 
# (ds)                        -> code       -> software

# Algorithm
# step by step procedure to solve a problem efficiently
